Hello, nickname's DIP!
And this is a compilation of all of the long notes mentioned throughout the code.


[1]	CANNOT MOVE OR ROTATE THE TERRAIN:
	As you might have noticed, you cannot move or rotate the terrain. That's because
	the grass shader is statically mapping the world coordinates and for one, to move
	the texture UV you'd need fragment's NODE_POSITION_WORLD and varyings cannot be
	passed from fragment to vertex (We need to vertex color for performance). And to
	top it off, rotating an UV is an extra expense!
	This means that you can't really create more that one map per scene
